This project showcases foundational machine learning techniques using Python, focusing on **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** models. It serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate model building, evaluation, and interpretation for both regression and classification tasks.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Linear Regression**: Used to predict continuous values such as sales or prices.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks such as predicting customer churn or loan default.
- **Workflow**:
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Visualizations for model interpretation (e.g., regression line, confusion matrix, ROC curve)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## üìä Output

- Performance metrics like R¬≤, MAE (for Linear Regression)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC (for Logistic Regression)
- Clear plots and model insights


This project reflects my hands-on understanding of basic supervised machine learning models, with emphasis on interpretability, performance, and best practices in model development.
